# bin-day
## Find out what type of bin collection is next for your postcode and address

Takes user input of their postcode and address, in a single line. 

Uses Selenium to check the council website for bin collection details, and returns the date of the next bin collection and the colour of the bin that will be collected.

You will need to install the appropriate webdriver in your system PATH. Ensure the chromedriver is compatible with your current Chrome version.
